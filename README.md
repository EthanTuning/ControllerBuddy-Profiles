## ControllerBuddy-Profiles

#### Description:
This repository contains a collection of profiles for the [ControllerBuddy](https://github.com/bwRavencl/ControllerBuddy) gamepad mapping software.  
All profiles were created by the author of ControllerBuddy and target a variety of flight simulators.  
Please note that these profiles are constantly updated and may change significantly over time.

#### Instructions:
- The `.json` files are ControllerBuddy profile files and can be loaded with said application.
- Inside the `configs` subfolder are game configuration files for use with the aforementioned profiles.
- These configuration files were created for use with a DualShock 4 controller, if you are using a different type of controller you may need to manually configure your game to ignore all inputs from your physical controller, to prevent potential interferences with the input coming via ControllerBuddy and vJoy.
